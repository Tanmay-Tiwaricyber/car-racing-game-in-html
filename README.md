The performance of this game is very machine/browser dependent. It works quite well in modern browsers, especially those with GPU canvas acceleration, but a bad graphics driver can kill it stone dead. So your mileage may vary. There are controls provided to change the rendering resolution and the draw distance to scale to fit your machine.

Currently supported browsers include:

Firefox (v12+) works great, 60fps at high res - Nice!
Chrome (v19+) works great, 60fps at high res... provided you dont have a bad GPU driver
IE9 - ok, 30fps at medium res... not great, but at least it works
The current state of mobile browser performance is pretty dismal. Dont expect this to be playable on any mobile device.
